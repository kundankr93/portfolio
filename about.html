            <strong>Mahabodhi Temple: A Sacred Buddhist Site</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Mahabodhi Temple</strong>, located in <strong>Bodh Gaya, Bihar</strong>, is one of the holiest sites in Buddhism. It marks the place where <strong>Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment</strong> under the <strong>Bodhi tree</strong> over 2,500 years ago. The temple is a UNESCO <strong>World Heritage Site</strong>, attracting pilgrims and tourists from across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Architecture and Significance</strong><br>
            Built during the reign of Emperor <strong>Ashoka</strong> in the 3rd century BCE, the temple has undergone multiple restorations. The current structure, dating back to the 5th–6th century CE, is a stunning example of ancient Indian architecture, featuring a 50-meter-high pyramidal spire, intricate carvings, and a central shrine housing a golden Buddha statue.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the heart of the temple complex lies the <strong>Bodhi Tree</strong>, believed to be a descendant of the original tree under which Buddha meditated. Nearby, the <strong>Vajrasana (Diamond Throne)</strong>, built by Ashoka, marks the precise spot of enlightenment. Other notable structures include meditation gardens, monasteries, and the Muchalinda Lake, where Buddha is said to have meditated while protected by the serpent king Muchalinda.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Religious and Cultural Importance</strong><br>
            The Mahabodhi Temple is a revered pilgrimage site for Buddhists worldwide, especially from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Tibet. It serves as a center for prayers, meditation, and Buddhist teachings. The temple is particularly vibrant during <strong>Buddha Purnima</strong>, celebrating Buddha’s birth, enlightenment, and death.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
            The Mahabodhi Temple stands as a symbol of peace, spirituality, and enlightenment. Its historical, architectural, and religious significance makes it one of the most important spiritual landmarks in the world. Visiting this sacred site offers a glimpse into the profound legacy of Buddhism and its teachings.
